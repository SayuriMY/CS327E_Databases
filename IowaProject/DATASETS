Iowa Alcohol Sales - https://data.iowa.gov/Economy/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy   
The original dataset contains the spirits purchase information of Iowa Class “E” liquor licensees by product and date of purchase  
from January 1, 2012 to current. We used PostgreSQL to cut the data from 2012-18 to 2014 & 2015.  

We added a "TempKey" Column to the Sales table to add a primary key using this Query:
Select row_number() over (order by COALESCE(County,'X-Unassigned'), ItemNum, Sale_Dollars_) as TempKey,  
  ItemNum, StoreNum, COALESCE(County,'X-Unassigned') as County, 
  Sale_Dollars_, VolSold_L_, BottlesSold

Liquor Liscense Revocations - http://db.desmoinesregister.com/owi-revocations-by-county  
This dataset contains data about the number of driver license revocations for operating while intoxicated from 2000 to 2015.  

Drunk Driving Deaths - http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/iowa/2014/measure/factors/134/data  
This dataset contains data about motor vehicle crash deaths with alcohol involvement.  

These three datasets are able to be connected through the year 2014, 2015 and Counties.   
We will be trying to see the relationship between the purchases of alcohol, driver license revocations for operating while 
intoxicated and motor vehicle crash deaths with alcohol involvement, all in Iowa and sorted by their counties.  

Big Questions:   
Do the ratios between Population, Alcohol Sales, and Motor Vehicle Crash Deaths with alcohol involvement per county differ by a   
wide range or are they consistent throughout the state of Iowa?  
Are the ratios between Vehicle Crash Deaths with alcohol involvement and driver license revocations per county differ by a wide   
range or are they consistent throughout the state of Iowa?  
Are there differences between the years 2014 and 2015?
